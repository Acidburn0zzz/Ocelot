Ocelot requires the following:

libboost_thread >= 1.44.0
libmysqlpp >= 3.0.0
libev >= 3.43 
g++ >= 4.3.2

There is no autoconfigure file yet, so you may need to play with the makefile.
A common tripping point is that your libboost_thread may be called libbost_thread-mt,
or you may need to include files from strange include directories.

Once everything is okay, just type 'make'.

Have fun :P
